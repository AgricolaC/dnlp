# ðŸ§  Deep Natural Language Processing â€“ Study Repo

This repository documents my studies and experiments in **Deep Natural Language Processing (DNLP)**, part of my Masterâ€™s in Data Science & Engineering at Politecnico di Torino.  

It contains from-scratch implementations, hands-on notebooks, and course-related projects.  
All personal study notes (Zettelkasten in Obsidian) remain private â€” this repo is for **code and project deliverables only**.

## ðŸš€ Contents

- `notebooks/` â†’ Jupyter notebooks for hands-on coding  
- `src/` â†’ Clean Python implementations of core methods  
- `data/` â†’ Small datasets (large datasets excluded via `.gitignore`)  
- `projects/` â†’ Larger course-related or portfolio-ready projects

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- Bag-of-Words & TF-IDF representations  
- Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, fastText)  
- Contextual embeddings (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.)  
- Transformers (attention mechanisms, encoderâ€“decoder)
